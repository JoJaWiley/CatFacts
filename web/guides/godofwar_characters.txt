"God of War" (2018) introduces a fresh take on the iconic characters from the original series. Here's an extensive background on the key characters in the game:

1. **Kratos:** The protagonist of the series, Kratos is a Spartan warrior turned God of War. In this installment, he has left behind his violent past in Greece and now resides in the world of Norse mythology. Kratos is burdened by his tragic past and seeks to start anew while raising his son, Atreus. He is gruff, stoic, and relentless in battle, but also learns to balance his anger with wisdom and compassion.

2. **Atreus (Loki):** Atreus is Kratos' young son, who joins him on their journey through the Norse realms. Atreus is resourceful, curious, and intelligent, with a deep knowledge of Norse mythology. He possesses the abilities of a demigod, inherited from his divine heritage as the son of Kratos and the Norse goddess, Faye (also known as Laufey). Atreus plays a pivotal role in the story, providing support in combat and unraveling the secrets of their journey.

3. **Faye (Laufey):** Faye is Kratos' wife and Atreus' mother. Although she passes away before the events of the game, her presence and legacy drive the story forward. Faye was a guardian of the giants, and her origins and connection to the Norse pantheon are unveiled as the game progresses.

4. **Mimir:** Mimir is a severed head who becomes an ally to Kratos and Atreus. Known for his wisdom and knowledge, Mimir serves as a guide, providing insights into Norse mythology and helping the duo navigate the treacherous realms they traverse. He is a source of humor and wisdom, offering guidance and anecdotes throughout their journey.

5. **Baldur:** Baldur is one of the primary antagonists in the game, a powerful Norse god immune to physical pain. He seeks to fulfill a prophecy that involves Kratos and Atreus. Baldur's relentless pursuit of his goal makes him a formidable adversary, and his complex relationship with his mother Freya adds depth to his character.

6. **Freya (Freyja):** Freya is a powerful Vanir goddess and mother of Baldur. She plays a significant role in the game, both as an ally and an obstacle to Kratos and Atreus. Freya's protective nature drives her actions, and her unique abilities as a practitioner of powerful magic make her a formidable force.

7. **Brok and Sindri:** Brok and Sindri are two dwarven blacksmiths encountered throughout the game. They provide Kratos and Atreus with valuable upgrades and equipment, often engaging in humorous banter and sibling rivalry. Their assistance is crucial in enhancing Kratos' combat abilities and navigating various challenges.

8. **The World Serpent (JÃ¶rmungandr):** The massive World Serpent is a mythical creature that spans the waters of the Norse realms. Although initially seen as a threat, it eventually forms a unique bond with Kratos and Atreus, aiding them in their journey. The World Serpent's presence and enigmatic nature hold important connections to Norse mythology.

These characters, along with a host of other gods, creatures, and beings from Norse mythology, populate the rich and immersive world of "God of War." Through their interactions, struggles, and personal journeys, the game explores themes of family, redemption, and the consequences of one's actions.
